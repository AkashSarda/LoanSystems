This is our first Decentralised Application, (DAPP).

This is a simulation of a decentralised money lending system, which is a business where the contracter gets money from lenders and lends that money to borrowers, earning commission in the process.

The poe.sol is a proof of existence contract which has a listing of assets owned by people. The asset is leased for a loan. This contract is used by the company for verifictaion purposes. This contract is supposed to be maintained globally. (assumption).
